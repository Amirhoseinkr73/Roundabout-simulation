# Roundabout-simulation
This repository provides the simulation scripts, configuration files, and analysis code used in our study on evaluating the impact of Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) on the capacity of a single-lane roundabout. The simulation is conducted using SUMO (Simulation of Urban MObility) and employs the Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) to model car-following behavior. Capacity is estimated using two speed-density models (Papageorgiou and Underwood) and the Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (MFD).

ðŸ“Œ Key Features:

Microscopic simulation with configurable CAV penetration rates

IDM parameter tuning for both manual and autonomous vehicles

Capacity estimation using both Papageorgiou and Underwood models

Aggregated output analysis to evaluate flow and critical density improvements

ðŸ“Š Findings: CAVs improve both link-level and network-level capacity, with diminishing returns at high penetration rates (>80%).
