# Roundabout-simulation
Simulation study on how Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) affect roundabout capacity using IDM in SUMO. Includes scenario-based analysis with varying CAV rates, two speed-density models (Papageorgiou, Underwood), and capacity estimation using the Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram.
